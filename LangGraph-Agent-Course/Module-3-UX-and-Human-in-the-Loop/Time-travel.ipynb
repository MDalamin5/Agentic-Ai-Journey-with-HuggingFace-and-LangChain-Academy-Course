    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- In LangGraph, a \"checkpoint ID\" is an identifier that distinguishes a specific checkpoint within a thread. Think of it as a unique snapshot of the graph's state at a particular point in time during its execution, tagged with a specific thread ID. \n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "- Thread:\n",
    "A thread in LangGraph represents a unique session or conversation associated with a graph execution. \n",
    "- Checkpoint:\n",
    "A checkpoint is a snapshot of the graph's state at a particular super-step (a point where the graph executes a batch of nodes). \n",
    "- Checkpoint ID:\n",
    "Each checkpoint within a thread is given a unique ID, allowing you to refer to that specific state snapshot. This ID helps you navigate the history of the thread and access the graph's state at different points. \n",
    "- In essence, the checkpoint ID is like a key that unlocks a specific moment in the graph's execution history, allowing you to retrieve the state of the graph as it was at that particular point in time within a given thread. "
