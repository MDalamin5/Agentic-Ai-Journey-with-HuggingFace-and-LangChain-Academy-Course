# Personal AI Assistant Project - Implementation Checklist

- [ ] **Step 1: Setup Project Environment:** Initialize project structure, install Langchain, LangGraph, Groq client, and other dependencies.
- [ ] **Step 2: Define Agent State:** Create the `AgentState` TypedDict or Pydantic model.
- [ ] **Step 3: Build Core Orchestrator Graph:** Implement basic nodes (input parsing, LLM call, output formatting) and edges for the main graph.
- [ ] **Step 4: Integrate Checkpointer:** Add `SqliteSaver` to the main graph for state persistence and time travel.
- [ ] **Step 5: Implement Long-Term Memory:** Create logic for loading and saving the `user_profile.json`.
- [ ] **Step 6: Develop Task Manager Sub-graph:** Build the `TaskManagerAgent` graph with nodes for task operations (create, list, update, delete).
- [ ] **Step 7: Integrate Task Manager Sub-graph:** Add nodes to the orchestrator to invoke the `TaskManagerAgent`.
- [ ] **Step 8: Develop Note Taker Sub-graph:** Build the `NoteTakerAgent` graph with nodes for note operations (create, retrieve).
- [ ] **Step 9: Implement Map-Reduce:** Build the note summarization map-reduce node within the `NoteTakerAgent`.
- [ ] **Step 10: Integrate Note Taker Sub-graph:** Add nodes to the orchestrator to invoke the `NoteTakerAgent`.
- [ ] **Step 11: Implement Human-in-the-Loop:** Add conditional logic and user interaction nodes/edges.
- [ ] **Step 12: Test and Refine:** Conduct thorough testing of individual components and the end-to-end flow. Debug as needed.
- [ ] **Step 13: Document Code:** Add comments and a README explaining setup, execution, and concept implementations.
