    "`CLIP` is a is a multimodal vision and language model motivated by overcoming the fixed number of object categories when training a computer vision model. CLIP learns about images directly from raw text by jointly training on 400M (image, text) pairs. Pretraining on this scale enables zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks. CLIP uses an image encoder and text encoder to get visual features and text features. Both features are projected to a latent space with the same number of dimensions and their dot product gives a similarity score."
